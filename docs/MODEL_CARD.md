# Model Card — Ladywood Demand Predictor

Following the spirit of [Mitchell et al., "Model Cards for Model Reporting"
(2019)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.03993): what this model is, what it was
trained on, how it performs, and — most importantly — exactly where its
limits are.

## Model details

> Why XGBoost rather than ARIMA, an LSTM/GNN, or another tree ensemble? See
> [`docs/design/MODEL_COMPARISON.md`](design/MODEL_COMPARISON.md) for the full,
> sourced comparison — including the published results that *don't* favour us.

- **Type**: XGBoost gradient-boosted regression tree ensemble
- **Task**: predict `boardings` (passenger count) for a given Ladywood bus
  stop, hour of day, and set of conditions (day type, weather, special event,
  school/university term)
- **Training script**: `prediction model/generate_real_demand_dataset.py`
- **Artefact**: `prediction model/demand_model.pkl`
- **Runtime entry point**: `predict_window_demand()` — called live by the
  dashboard's `/api/demand` endpoint and offline by the route optimiser

## Intended use

Generating *relative* demand signals — which stops, at which times, under
which conditions, are likely to see more or fewer boarders than others — to
drive a capacitated VRP route optimiser and a public-facing demand
visualisation. **It is not** intended as a source of absolute, audited
ridership counts, nor as a substitute for a direct Automatic Passenger
Counting (APC) data feed (see [Caveats](#known-limitations--the-honest-gap)).

## Training data — what's real and what isn't

| Component | Status | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Stop coordinates, road geometry | **Real** | TfWM GTFS (open licence) |
| Weather (2023–24, hourly) | **Real** | Open-Meteo historical archive |
| School/university term dates | **Real** | Birmingham LA term + bank-holiday calendars |
| Per-stop demand anchor | **Real** | UCL/GEoDS ENCTS concessionary smartcard journey volumes, TfWM-linked, 2010–2016 |
| Per-stop static features (`imd_score`, `poi_total`, `population`, `crime_total_2024`, `elevation_m`) | **Real** | IMD 2019, OSM, ONS Census 2021, police.uk, elevation API |
| **Hour-of-day demand shape** (commuter-peak curves) | **Synthetic** | Modelled — no public per-hour boarding curves exist for these stops |
| **Special events** (festivals, road closures) | **Synthetic** | Modelled — no public event/disruption logs exist for these stops |

263,160 rows (every real day in the 2023–24 weather archive × 15 stops × 24
hours), built by `generate_real_demand_dataset.py`. This supersedes an earlier,
fully-synthetic 65k-row baseline (`generate_map_dataset.py`) which is retained
in the repo for the before/after comparison documented in the
[README](../README.md#from-synthetic-to-real-how-the-demand-model-evolved).

## Headline performance

| Metric | Value | Split |
|---|---|---|
| **R² (primary, reported)** | **0.945** (RMSE 4.57 boardings) | Temporal — train 2023, test unseen 2024 |
| R² (random split) | 0.949 (RMSE 4.45) | Random 80/20 |

The temporal split is reported as primary because it cannot be inflated by
within-period row leakage — it's the honest measure of "how well does this
generalise to a year it has never seen."

## Robustness — six independent checks (full data: [`robustness.json`](../analysis/outputs/robustness.json))

| Check | Result | What it rules out |
|---|---|---|
| Random vs. temporal split | R² 0.949 vs. 0.945 (gap = 0.004) | Row-level autocorrelation inflating the headline score |
| Anchor sensitivity (±20% perturbation of the smartcard demand anchor) | R² spread = 0.0004 (0.9439 / 0.9439 / 0.9443) | The result being an artefact of the *exact magnitude* of one decade-old, concessionary-only data source — the model is learning demand *shape*, not memorising one source's scale |
| Year shift (train 2023→test 2024 and reverse) | avg R² = 0.9449 | The model memorising one year's idiosyncrasies rather than stable structure |
| Season shift (train winter→test summer and reverse) | avg R² = 0.9339 | — and quantifies the honest bound: a ~0.011 drop is the expected, informative cost of extrapolating across a seasonal regime change |

**Interpretation**: the 0.945 headline is stable under every stress test we
could construct from available data. The one consistent, expected weak point
is cross-season transfer (0.934 vs. 0.945 in-distribution) — exactly what
you'd expect from a model that has correctly learned "winter and summer demand
patterns differ" rather than memorised a single regime.

## Known limitations — the honest gap

This is the single most important section of this card, and the project's
central honesty disclosure (also covered in the README's
[Caveats](../README.md#caveats)):

> **The *absolute scale* and *hour-of-day shape* of demand at these specific
> stops have never been directly observed.** No public per-hour boarding
> curves or event/disruption logs exist for Ladywood stops. The 0.945 R² should
> therefore be read as *"this model is highly self-consistent with a
> realistically-anchored generative process,"* **not** *"this model has been
> validated against ground-truth ridership."* The per-stop demand *anchor* is
> real (UCL/GEoDS smartcard data); the *temporal curve* layered on top of that
> anchor is the project's own, carefully-reasoned, but ultimately synthetic
> construction.

A second, related check — `analysis/gtfs_validate.py`, comparing the model's
predicted hour-of-day demand *shape* per stop against real TfWM GTFS service
frequency as a proxy for ridership pattern — returns a **median Pearson
correlation of 0.06** across the 45 stop/day-type combinations evaluated (full
data: [`gtfs_validation.json`](../analysis/outputs/gtfs_validation.json)). We
report this number plainly rather than omit it: it confirms that *service
frequency* is a weak proxy for *ridership shape* at this resolution (operators
set timetables on more than just measured demand — political, contractual, and
historical constraints all play in), and it underlines why the anchor-based,
not shape-validated, framing above is the correct one to present. **The path
to closing this gap is a direct TfWM Automatic Passenger Counting (APC) data
request or a manual stop-level traffic survey** — see
[Caveats](../README.md#caveats) for the full discussion of next steps.

## Statistical assumptions, and what would break them

The robustness checks above test whether the *headline number* survives
reasonable stress — they don't, by themselves, name the *assumptions* the
whole modelling approach rests on. A reviewer specifically asked us to do
that: name the assumptions, and say how robust we are to their violation.
Here is that discussion, done properly rather than gestured at.

**The core assumption.** Like all standard supervised learning (XGBoost
included), this model is fit by empirical risk minimisation, which formally
assumes training rows are **independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.)**
— that no row's value can be predicted from another's, and that every row is
drawn from the same underlying generative process as the rows the model will
later be asked to score
([overview of i.i.d. assumptions in CV](https://towardsdatascience.com/4-things-to-do-when-applying-cross-validation-with-time-series-c6a5674ebf3a/)).
Transit data violates both halves of this by construction:

- **Independence**: demand at the same stop an hour apart is highly
  autocorrelated, and demand at neighbouring stops is correlated by
  Tobler's First Law of Geography — "near things are more related than
  distant things"
  ([geographyrealm.com](https://www.geographyrealm.com/toblers-first-law-geography/)).
  Naively shuffled cross-validation on data like this leaks information from
  "the future" or "the next stop over" into training, producing
  **optimistically biased validation scores** — a well-documented failure
  mode ([Roberts et al. 2017, *Ecography*](https://www.wsl.ch/lud/biodiversity_events/papers/Roberts_et_al-2017-Ecography.pdf);
  [scikit-learn's own caution on this](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/cross_validation.html)).
  **This is precisely why we report the temporal split (train 2023 → test
  unseen 2024) as the primary number, not the random 80/20 split** — the
  0.004 gap between them (0.945 vs. 0.949) is our direct, quantified evidence
  that row-level leakage is *not* meaningfully inflating our headline figure.
- **Representativeness**: the model can only be expected to generalise to
  conditions resembling those in its training window (2023–24 weather, the
  current route network, the current built environment). Gradient-boosted
  trees predict via piecewise-constant leaf averages and **structurally
  cannot extrapolate beyond the range of values seen in training**
  ([machinelearningmastery.com](https://machinelearningmastery.com/xgboost-for-time-series-forecasting/))
  — any future combination of conditions outside that range (a heatwave
  beyond anything in the 2023–24 archive, a new tram line, a major
  regeneration scheme reshaping the IMD profile) is something this model is
  guaranteed to handle by *flattening toward its nearest seen analogue*, not
  by reasoning correctly about the new regime.

**What "the model fails under structural problems" actually means, with a
real number attached.** The textbook term is a **structural break** — an
abrupt shift in the underlying data-generating process
([Wikipedia, Structural break](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_break)).
The canonical real-world transit example is COVID-19: a peer-reviewed 2024
study found the pandemic "introduced substantial changes in transit ridership
levels and seasonal patterns" that materially degraded forecasting model
performance
([Springer, *Public Transport*, 2024](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12469-024-00368-5)).
For a sense of *magnitude* — not from transit, but the same mechanism
(a sudden shift in both the inputs' distribution and the input→output
relationship) — Instacart's grocery-availability forecasting accuracy fell
from **93% to 61%** when COVID abruptly changed shopping behaviour
([aerospike.com](https://aerospike.com/blog/model-drift-machine-learning/)).
We cite that figure explicitly as a **cross-domain illustrative analogy**, not
a transit-specific result — but it puts a real number on what "fails under
structural change" can mean for a model of this class, and it is the right
order of magnitude to take seriously: our 0.945 could plausibly become
something closer to Instacart's 61% under an equivalent shock, not just dip a
few points the way our season-shift check (0.934) suggests for *ordinary*
seasonal variation.

**What we would do about it — concrete next steps, not just acknowledgement.**
Two established techniques would let us *measure* rather than guess at this:

1. **Conformalised Quantile Regression (CQR)** — produces prediction
   intervals with a *distribution-free, guaranteed coverage probability*,
   meaning the uncertainty estimate itself stays valid even when the
   underlying distributional assumptions break
   ([Manokhin, on CQR](https://valeman.medium.com/conformalized-quantile-regression-smarter-uncertainty-prediction-for-data-scientists-6389bea7a7c4);
   [Boosted Conformal Prediction Intervals, arXiv:2406.07449](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.07449)).
   Adding this would turn "the model says 40 boardings" into "the model says
   40, with 90% confidence the true value is between 28 and 55" — and that
   interval would visibly widen exactly when the model is being asked to
   predict outside its evidentiary basis.
2. **Out-of-distribution flagging at inference time** — checking whether a
   requested combination of conditions (hour, weather, event type, term
   status) falls inside the convex hull of the training data, and surfacing
   that to the dashboard's "what-if" panel rather than silently returning a
   point estimate the model has no real basis for.

Both are concrete, scoped engineering tasks we can point to as the genuine
next phase of this work — converting "we know this could fail" into "here is
how we would know *when* it has."

## Ethical considerations

- The demand anchor (UCL/GEoDS smartcard data) is **concessionary-only**
  (predominantly older and disabled passengers) and **decade-old**
  (2010–2016). Both the anchor-sensitivity check above and the explicit
  framing in this card exist specifically to bound and disclose that
  limitation rather than let it pass silently.
- Predicted demand directly drives which stops get more service under the
  optimiser — an under- or over-estimate at a given stop has a real equity
  consequence. This is why [`analysis/equity.py`](../analysis/equity.py)
  exists as a standing check on the optimiser's output, not just the model's
  accuracy (see the README's [Equity](../README.md#equity) section).
