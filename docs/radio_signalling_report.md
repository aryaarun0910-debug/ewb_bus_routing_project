# Live Hub-to-Stop Signalling: A LoRa Radio Architecture for the FPGA Demand Display

*A proposed next phase for the FPGA LED bus-stop display — turning the current static demo into a live, hub-broadcast system.*

## 1. The problem

The current FPGA LED map (see [`fpga/`](../fpga/)) animates buses and demand patterns from **pre-baked ROM tables** generated once from `route_plan.json`. It looks great as a community-facing demo, but it has no live data link — it can't reflect a route that has just been re-optimised in response to changing conditions (weather, an event, a service disruption). This report sketches how a real deployment would close that gap: a central hub broadcasting live route/demand updates by radio to small, low-power receiver units mounted at each bus stop.

## 2. Why radio, and why LoRa specifically

Three signalling options were considered:

| Option | Range | Power | Cost/unit | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Wi-Fi | ~50 m indoors | High (needs mains) | Low | Needs infrastructure (router) at every stop — impractical |
| Bluetooth / BLE | ~10–100 m | Low | Low | Range far too short for hub-to-many-stops |
| **LoRa (433 MHz)** | **Hundreds of metres – several km** | **Very low (battery/solar viable)** | **~£15–20** | **Best fit** |

LoRa (Long Range radio, e.g. the Semtech SX1278 chipset) trades data rate for range and power efficiency — it's slow (kilobits per second) and high-latency, which usually rules it out for real-time telemetry. **That trade-off doesn't matter here**: route/demand data updates on the scale of minutes to hours (per scenario/time-window), not milliseconds. A tiny periodic packet — "stop S04: demand=high, next bus ETA=4 min, route colour=amber" — is exactly the payload LoRa was designed to carry.

## 3. Proposed architecture

![Proposed LoRa link: central hub (route optimiser + FastAPI backend) transmits over 433 MHz LoRa to stop units, which receive via UART, drive a microcontroller/FPGA, and light WS2812B LEDs; an optional ack/telemetry channel runs back to the hub](diagrams/lora_architecture.png)

- **Hub**: the existing route-optimiser/backend gains a small broadcast service — every time a scenario re-solves (e.g. conditions change, or on a fixed cadence), it pushes a compact packet per stop (or a batched packet covering all stops on one route) out over a LoRa transmitter attached via UART/SPI.
- **Stop unit**: a small low-power receiver (LoRa module + microcontroller, or feeding straight into the FPGA's UART pins) decodes the packet and updates the LED display accordingly — no change needed to the WS2812B driving logic already proven in `fpga/bus_route.v`, just a new data source replacing the static ROM lookup.
- **Mesh option**: modules such as the DFRobot LoRa MESH variant can relay packets stop-to-stop, extending the hub's effective reach past line-of-sight without extra infrastructure — useful in a built-up area like Ladywood where buildings would otherwise block a direct hub→stop link.

## 4. Power and practicality

A genuine strength of this approach: **no mains wiring required at each stop**. SX1278-class modules draw very little current, run off 1.8–3.6 V, and pair naturally with a small battery + solar trickle-charge — the kind of self-contained unit that could realistically be retrofitted onto an existing bus-stop post without civil works.

## 5. What this would change for the FPGA design

Critically, **this requires no rework of the WS2812B driving logic** already built and reviewed in `fpga/bus_route.v` — `cur_color`, the bit-bang FSM, and the bus-animation state machines stay as-is. The only change is the *data source*: instead of selecting a row from an auto-generated ROM table via switches (`SW[1:0]`/`SW[4:2]`), the design would read the same shape of data (stop demand levels, active route) from a UART register fed by the LoRa receiver. This is a clean, additive next phase rather than a redesign.

## 6. Security

A LoRa broadcast is visible to anyone with a receiver. Without authentication, a cheap SX1278 transmitter — available for around £15 — could broadcast false demand data to every stop unit in range, causing the LED maps to display misinformation to exactly the residents who can least afford to cross-check it on a smartphone. A deployed system addresses this at three levels.

**Payload authentication — AES-128-CMAC on every packet.** LoRaWAN provides this natively via network and application session keys; even a bare point-to-point SX1278 link adds it in a few hundred bytes of firmware. The hub signs each packet's payload — `{stop_id, demand_tier, route_colour, ETA, frame_counter}` — and the stop unit rejects any packet whose MAC does not verify against the pre-shared key.

**Replay protection — monotonic frame counter.** Each packet carries an incrementing counter; the receiver stores the last-seen value and drops anything ≤ it. A captured authentic packet cannot be replayed later to freeze the display on stale or attacker-chosen data.

**Fail-safe default, not fail-dangerous.** On an invalid MAC, a stale frame counter, or no valid packet for *N* minutes, the stop unit does not continue displaying old or attacker-supplied data — it shows an explicit "no live data" state (all-amber dim, or the static timetable colour-coding). A blank or visibly uncertain display is honest; a confidently lying one is not. The people who depend on this information most are the least able to detect a lie — the equity argument for getting this right is the same as the equity argument for building the system in the first place.

**Key management.** Keys are provisioned at installation and rotated on the maintenance schedule that CIVIC SQUARE already stewards for the physical stop units — tying cryptographic hygiene to the existing community maintenance model rather than requiring a separate technical process.

## 7. Honest limitations to flag

- **Latency**: LoRa packets take longer to transmit than Wi-Fi/Bluetooth — fine for "demand updates every few minutes," not for "exact live bus position to the metre."
- **Urban range**: the "several km" figures are open-air; buildings and street furniture in a dense urban area like Ladywood will reduce effective range — a mesh topology (§3) mitigates this.
- **Regulatory**: 433 MHz is a licence-free ISM band in the UK, but transmit duty-cycle and power limits apply (typically <10% duty cycle, ≤10 mW ERP in the relevant sub-band) — any real deployment would need to design the broadcast schedule around these limits.

## 8. Suggested next step

A small bench prototype: one LoRa transmitter on a Raspberry Pi (standing in for the hub backend) broadcasting a mock "stop demand" packet, and one receiver feeding a microcontroller driving a handful of WS2812B LEDs (standing in for a stop unit). This would prove the data path end-to-end before any integration with the full FPGA design — and would make for a compelling "here's the live version, in progress" demo addition alongside the existing static FPGA display.
